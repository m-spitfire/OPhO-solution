    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
        \item 
        Assume that body is moving with speed $v$ on circle radius $r$.

        Since we are lookig at small interval of time the $\alpha$ is small angle. We can approximate the distance body went $x=vt$. At the same time due to small interval $x=r\alpha$ here there's no derivative it's just definiton of radian.
        The acceleration of body is directed downward at that interval of time. So we can approximate that $v_y=at$ where $a=\frac{v^2}{r}$. And at the same time $v_y^2=v^2-v_x^2$ where $v_x=v\cos\alpha$.
        So substituting all we get that $\sin^2\alpha=\alpha^2$. Here we can use the trigoometric identity $\sin^2 x=\frac{1-\cos 2x}{2}$. And we get
        \begin{align*}
            \cos 2\alpha=1-2\alpha^2 &\quad \text{Substitute $2\alpha=x$}\\
            \cos x=1-\frac{x^2}{2}&
        \end{align*}
